# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Task

A hypothetical client hired me to refactor their webpages html/css to improve future readability, improve accessability, and increase SEO. 

### Without changing functionality, I was to:

-Refactor code to use semantic HTML elements.

-Refactor and organize code for future readability.

-Ensure heading attributes were in proper order.

-Add a concise title to the webpage.

-Add alt text to icons and images.


### Link to Deployed Webpage

TBA when webpage is deployed. 

### Solved Issues 

-Code has been refactored to distinct header, main, aside, and footer sections. 

-Combined redundant classes, and removed classes that had to be added to label and style header/footer sections. Left "benefits" class and renamed "content" class to "services" to help future devs quickly understand purposes of those sections. 

-Moved incorrectly added hero image from css to html. Added alt text to hero image, images in main, and icons in aside. 

-Changed footer header attribute from h2 to h4. 

-Added descriptive title to webpage that is concise enough to not be cut off when displayed by search engines.

-Found bug copyright notice was out of date. Updated. 

-Found broken "Search Engine Optimization" link. Fixed. 


### Unsolved Issues / Newly Found Bugs
Several color shades did not match. Unsure if intended style or not, but did not touch. Created labeled variables and changed hardcoded colors to assist style team to quickly fix if error or help future devs should branding should change. 

Some styling elements are not optimized for mobile compatable and break at tablet and smaller sized viewports. Untouched.
